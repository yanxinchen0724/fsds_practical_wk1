    "This week’s practical is focussed on getting you set up with the tools and accounts that you’ll need to across many of the CASA modules in Terms 1 and 2, and familiarising you with ‘how people do data science’. Outside of academia, it’s rare to find a data scientist who works entirely on their own: most code is collaborative, as is most analysis! But collaborating effectively requires tools that: get out of the way of doing ‘stuff’; support teams in negotating conflicts in code; make it easy to share results; and make it easy to ensure that everyone is ‘on the same page’."

    "\n",
    "One of the most confusing things about starting a Docker container with a \"local volume mount\" (i.e. a location on your computer that Docker *connects* to the container's file system) is that it seems like magic and it's often hard to understand why you're seeing what you are under the `work` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "So *before you do anything else* please spend a minute in the Terminal (macOS) or Power Shell (Windows) learning how to get to your home directory and, below that, to a CASA directory where you can store your work and keep Docker from accessing data that it shouldn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "On both a Mac and a PC you should be able to run the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `echo $(pwd)` -- this should print out the location where the Terminal/Power Shell 'started'.\n",
    "3. `cd $HOME` -- this should take you to your user's *home* directory (on a Mac it will be `/Users/<your username>`, on a PC it will be something like `C:\\Users\\<your username>`). *Hint: `cd` means 'change directory'!*\n",
    "4. `cd Documents` -- this will move you into your 'Documents' folder. *Note: on Windows this **might** be called `My\\ Documents` and note the \"\\\" in the name! If you have set up your computer in another language this might be called something else, but Power Shell still 'knows' which folder should contain your documents.*\n",
    "5. `mkdir casa` -- this will create a `casa` folder in your home directory.\n",
    "6. `cd casa` -- you are now changing into the `casa` directory.\n",
    "7. `echo $pwd` -- this should show you the 'full path' to your new `casa` directory (e.g. `/Users/<your username>/Documents/casa` or something like that).\n",

If you have a Mac or have installed a full Linux system for WSL2 (e.g. Ubuntu) on your Windows machine, then there is a 'bash script' and configuration file as [detailed here](https://jreades.github.io/sds_env/docker/#running-everything-script) that we created for you. This is the _easiest_ way to start/stop Docker.\n",
    "2. Using VSCode as [detailed here](https://jreades.github.io/sds_env/docker/#vscode-integration) to create a new VSCode project that is 'bound' to the Docker image. This will give you a very different experience of using Docker and Jupyter, but is appropriate for _those who want to use an IDE to write code_."
